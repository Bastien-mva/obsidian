## WHAT WE CAN DO 

- Two options is my limit 
- Bé a chooser, not a picker 
- Ask yourself what you really want in the areas of life where décision matters 
- Satisfice more and maximize less 
- Know what is good enough: 

1. think about occasions where you (can) get good enough 

2. scrutinize how you choose in your areas 

3. appli that strategy more broadly 

- For a relationship, dont think that you Can change, you will bé more happy in the relationship. 
- Bé grateful for thé choices we made and thé things right about it instead of sée the disavandtages (i.e. gratitude for a décision)

- Anticiper l'adaptation 
- Compare to others less 
- Focus on what makes YOU happy and what gives meaning yo YOUR life
