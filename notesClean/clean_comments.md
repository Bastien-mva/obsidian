## Comments
 
- comments are failures. We failed to have a clear code 
- spend time cleaning the mess rather than explaining the mess
- rename the function instead of comment the function. 
- amplicification: amplify a line 
- redundant comments are useless. The code should already be clear (explain something very clear.) 
- you should NOT have javadoc for every function
- Replace the temptation to create noise with the determination to clean your code.
- don’t use too much  /////////////////////////////
- don’t put too much information.
